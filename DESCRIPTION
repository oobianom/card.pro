Description: Responsive and modern 'HTML' card essentials for 'shiny' dashboard. This novel card component in 'Bootstrap' provides a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options for building robust 'R' based apps e.g for graph build or machine learning projects. The features rely on a combination of 'JQuery' <https://jquery.com> and 'CSS' styles to improve the card functionality.
